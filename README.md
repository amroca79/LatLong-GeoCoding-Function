# LatLong-GeoCoding-Function
My first function. The creation of this function arose with the need for more accurate coordinates in the city of Seattle. While using only the 'Geocoder' to retrieve the coordinates for Seattle neighborhoods, I noticed that the results weren't accurate. So I decided to use 'Geopy.Geocoders.Nominatim' instead. I was able to retrieve better results. However, the Geopy database had missing coordinates. So I decided to create a 'loop function' using the 'Geopy.Geocoders.Nominatim' as the primary 'geocoder' and the 'Geocoder' as a backup. Yet, they weren't perfect results, but better than the previous method.  *WARNING*: This function was created for academic purposes. Please check library rate limits.
